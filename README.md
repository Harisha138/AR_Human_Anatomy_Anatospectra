# AnatoSpectra – Human Anatomy Using Augmented Reality

AnatoSpectra is a Unity3D project designed to help learners study human anatomy interactively using *Augmented Reality (AR)*.  

The project allows users to:
- View and interact with 3D anatomical models  
- Rotate models for different perspectives  
- Switch between scenes for various anatomical systems  
- Read scrollable text descriptions for guided learning  

Unity3D was chosen because it supports AR, 3D modeling, and cross-platform deployment.
